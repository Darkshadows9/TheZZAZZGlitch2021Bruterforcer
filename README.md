# TheZZAZZGlitch2021Bruterforcer
A bruterforcer for TheZZAZZGlitch's 2021 April Fools event challenge 3

The .c file contains the complete brutforcer and the .asm is pseudo-gbasm that are my main notes to build the thing.

Compile the program with:

```
gcc -Wall -pedantic -O3 "Bruteforce.c" -o "Bruteforce.exe"
```

or on Linux:

```
gcc -Wall -pedantic -O3 "Bruteforce.c" -o "Bruteforce"
```

You can change the starting seed to whatever you want, it's currently set to start at the solution.

This whole thing is really rough and not well named, but it definitely works.
