# TheZZAZZGlitch2021Bruterforcer
A bruterforcer for TheZZAZZGlitch's 2021 April Fools event challenge 3

The .c file contains the complete brutforcer and the .asm is pseudo-gbasm that are my main notes to build the thing.

Compile the program with:

```
gcc -Wall -pedantic -O3 "Bruteforce.c" -o "Bruteforce.exe"
```

or on Linux:

```
gcc -Wall -pedantic -O3 "Bruteforce.c" -o "Bruteforce"
```

You can change the starting seed to whatever you want, it's currently set to start at the solution.

This whole thing is really messy and not well named, but it definitely works.

I wanna thank TheZZAZZGlitch for the event. It was really tough this year and I'm hopeful for the next one, since I met my own personal goal at least!
